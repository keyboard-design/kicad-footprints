This repo is intended to be a shared resource for the keyboard community to build a library of best-practice footprints for keyswitches and other related components like LEDs, connectors, socketable microcontrollers, etc.

We need to develop some naming conventions and design standards. For now, you should assume that everything in this repository is unstable.

Every footprint should have an associated file in the doc/ directory which describes the design decisions behind the footprint, points to a relevant datasheet or layout drawing, and provides usage notes.

If you'd like to contribute, please send a pull request.
